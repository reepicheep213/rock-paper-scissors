## Project Description

The project is to create a simple rock paper scissors game that can be played in the console using the early JavaScript concepts learned in the Foundations Course at The Odin Project.

## Learning Objectives

The objective is to apply JavaScript and practice problem-solving and researching skills, and, when the code isn't running as intended, to figure out and understand why it doesn't.
